# Matching-cards-OOP-Project-2nd-year

This is a classic matching cards game which is implemented in Java and it is based on MVC arhitecture. <br/>
The pokemons are the theme of the game and the player need to collect all the pokemons before the time ran out. When the game is loaded the player can choose the difficulty by right clicking on one of the buttons: very easy (find 4 pairs in 20 seconds), easy (find 8 pairs in 40 seconds), medium (find 10 pairs in 70 seconds), hard (find 12 pairs in 90 second) and very hard (find 16 pairs in 110 seconds). By selecting the difficulty level the cards will appear with the face up and the player have 3 seconds to memoreze them. After 3 second the cards are turned with the face down and the game starts. <br/>
If the player wins, then he can save his score in a score table which will be saved in a SER file. This file will be able to found in the MyDocuments folder. <br/>
All the features are implemented in Java: the model of the cards, the game logic, the GUI and the storage method (serialization).
